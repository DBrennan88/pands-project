The Fisher Iris Data set diplays variations of the Iris Plant. Contains 3 classess of 50 instances each. 3 classes are type of Iris plant. Each "instance" is a individual plant data points. 
3 clasees of Iris are Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica with data points of centimetres for Sepal length/width and patel length/width of 50 samples opf each type. 
The data set has a consistent structire with no missing fields and is used to teach machine learning,  data analysis and data visualization concepts.  

What am i trying to acheive here: 
Load the data set
import packages to begin analysis
visualise data - histogram for each of the 4 data points for compairson across the 3 classes of Iris


Write programme that will:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, 
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.
